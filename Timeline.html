This was the beginning of the great adventure of his life. On the&nbsp;Acushnet&nbsp;he spent the eighteen months which he recreated imaginatively years later in&nbsp;<em>Moby Dick</em>,&nbsp;escaping finally (July 9, 1842), when he could no longer endure the hardships of a whaleman&#39;s existence, at the Marquesas Islands, where, in company with his shipmate, Toby (Richard Tobias Greene), he experienced the adventures described in&nbsp;<em>Typee</em>."</p>

No one seemed to know anything of the one great writer fit to stand shoulder to shoulder with Whitman on that continent' (Academy,&#160;Aug. 15, 1885, p. 103)."</p>
